# Image-Steganography
Image steganography is a technique used to hide secret information within an image without altering its perceptual quality. It's a form of data hiding where text, files, or other data are concealed within the pixels of an image. This hidden information can only be extracted by someone who knows the steganographic method and has the appropriate decryption key. Steganography is often employed for covert communication or to protect sensitive data from detection. It's a field that combines elements of cryptography and a field that combines elements of cryptography and digital image processing to achieve its goals.
Code : 
  Here in this we use Tkinter library from python, for a GUI to get output of the code. it uses different functions to perform the operations on the code and give output.
  it pops out message box, in output interface after hiding, saving, and showing the secret image. For this we use " messagebox" keyword in the code. 
  Buttons are created in down frame as open, save, hide, show using " button " keyword.
